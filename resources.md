# Resources

Here is a list of resources for blind and visually impared Python programmers, learners, data scientists, and technologists.

## Listservs

- [Pythonvis](https://www.freelists.org/webpage/pythonvis)
	This is a mailing list for visually impaired Python programmers. It's pretty active.
- [program-l: V.I. Programmers Discussion List](https://www.freelists.org`/list/program-l)
	This is a quite active general mailling list for blind programmers.
- [Raspberry VI](https://www.freelists.org/list/raspberry-vi) 
	This is a mailing list for blind and VI Raspberry Pi enthusiasts and is a good place to ask about using Linux.

## Books

- [Learn Python 3 the Hard Way](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Python-Hard-Way-Introduction/dp/0134692888)
	I learned how to code from this book, which was free online at that time. 
- [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/)

## Textbooks

- [Introductory Statistics 2e](https://openstax.org/books/introductory-statistics-2e/pages/1-introduction)
	This free online (screen-reader-accessible) textbook from the OpenStax initiative is a great resource for aspiring (data) scientists, professionals, and anyone interested in building a foundational understanding of statistics. All figures have descriptive alt text, and all mathematical expressions/equations appear in [MathML](https://www.chhs.colostate.edu/accessibility/best-practices-how-tos/mathml/). Download and install the [MathCAT plugin for NVDA](https://addons.nvda-project.org/addons/MathCAT.en.html) to read and interactively navigate MathML.


## Other Projects for VI Data Science

- [Data Science and Machine Learning for the Visually Impaired](https://hassaku.github.io/DS-and-ML-with-screen-reader/)
- [Earsketch â€” Learn Python Through Music](earsketch.org)
