Sonification II: Creating Sonifications with Astronify

The Astronify Python package is intended for the sonification of light curve data, a specific type of astronomical data that shows the observed brightness, or flux, of a star as a function of time. However, given that light curves are one-dimensional data, Astronify can be more broadly applied to sonify data that would be visualized as a line graph for sighted audiences. We will begin by sonifying recognizable data such as a simple linear function to familiarize the audience with data analysis and exploration via sonification. The data prepared in the previous modules can then be sonified and explored using Astronify.
