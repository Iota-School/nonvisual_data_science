Sonification II: Creating Sonifications with Astronify

The Astronify Python package is intended for the sonification of light curve data, a specific type of astronomical data that shows the observed brightness, or flux, of a star as a function of time. However, given that light curves are one-dimensional data, Astronify can be more broadly applied to sonify data that would be visualized as a line graph for sighted audiences. We will begin by sonifying recognizable data such as a simple linear function to familiarize the audience with data analysis and exploration via sonification. The data prepared in the previous modules can then be sonified and explored using Astronify.

The sections we will cover are as follows:
- Importing and Exploring the Data
- Sonifying Temperature Data
- Scaling a Sonification
- Dealing with Missing Values
- Checking Models of Our Data with Sonification
- Astronify's Features (Bonus Section)
