# More Math

OK, we've learned the basics of reviewing. Let's try out a little more math. Go ahead and enter these four lines into the REPL:

```python
3 + 3
```

That's a three, a plus sign, and a three.

```python
10 - 4
```
That's a ten, a minus sign (or hypen), and a four.

```python
5 * 5
```

That's a five, an asterisk, and a five.

```python
9 / 3
```

That's a nine, a forward slash, and a three.

in Python, we use a minus (`-`)sign (or hyphen) for subtraction, an asterisk or star (`*`) for multiplication, and a forward slash (`/`) for division. There are other mathematical operators, but we'll stick to these for now.
