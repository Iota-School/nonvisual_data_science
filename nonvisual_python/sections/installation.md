# Installation

This workshop is focused on the Windows platform, since it goes into detail on the use of the Windows-specific NVDA screen reader.

## Installing NVDA

NVDA, or Non-Visual Desktop Access, is a screen reader for the Windows operating system. To install NVDA on a Windows computer, visit the [NVDA download page](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/) and download the software. (If you're using another screen reader, the download link is the first button on the page.) Run the executable and install using the default settings.

To start NVDA after installing it, hit the Windows button on your keyboard (also known as the meta button, most often located between your Control and Alt button on the lower left of your keyboard). Type `nvda` and hit enter to start the screen reader.

## Installing Anaconda

Anaconda is a distribution of Python, meaning it is a software package that includes Python, but also a number of other useful tools and utilities. Anaconda is specifically intended for supporting data science..

To install Anaconda, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Anaconda download page](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).
2. Click the Download link. (It's the second link after the `Free Download` heading.)
3. Run the executable.
4. Install using the default settings.

In this workshop, we'll be using the Anaconda Prompt (not the Anaconda Navigator). To open the Anaconda prompt, press the Windows button on your keyboard (also known as the `meta` button, usually located between the `Control` and `Alt` buttons on your keyboard.) Type "anaconda prompt" and Anaconda Prompt should be the first result. Hit Enter to start the program.
