# Data Science Fundamentals in Pandas

[Hungarian translation](hungarian-translation/README.md)

This workshop covers the fundamentals of using Pandas series and dataframe types to work with one- and two-dimensional data. We cover creating series and dataframes, looking up data by key and index, extracting rows and columns, using math operations on columns, using basic statistical methods such as mean and standard deviation, and chaining methods to answer more complex questions.
