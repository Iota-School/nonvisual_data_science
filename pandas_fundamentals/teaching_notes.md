## Dimensions

- One-dimensional data
- 10, 5, 8
- Index
- Two-dimensional data
- Locations in 2d data
- Columns and rows (x and y)
- Other dimensions (N-dimensional and 0-dimensional)

## Series

- Creaating a list (10, 10, 5 15, 15)
- Create series
- Explain series representation
- Mean()
- median()
- sort_values()
- Other series methods to try
- describe()

## Keys and Values

- Looking up data: slicing review
- Keys and values
- Creating a phone book
- Explain dictionaries

## Creating a dataframe

- Create three lists

	- budget = [10, 10, 5, 15, 15]
	- month = ["June", "July", "September", "October", "November"]n
	- cookie_budget = [3, 2, 0, 4, 5]
	
- Create monthly_budget dictionary
- Create dataframe
- Dataframe representation
- Not really missing out in not using representation

## Dataframe Fundamentals

- Columns and rows explanation
- Finding size of dataframe
- Getting columns index
- Overwrite the index with the month
- Pulling out a column
- Doubling the cookie budget
- Overwriting column
- Division to find percentage of each month's budget spent on cookies
- Pulling out rows with loc and iloc
- Briefly touch on df.info()

## Airbnb Dataset

- df = pandas.read_csv('https://bit.ly/nycbnb')
- Shape
- columns
- list() on columns for review
- Look at numerical, textual, categorical
- Use head(0 and tail()

## Look at prices

- mean()
- Chaining
- median()
- Explain right-skewed distribution
- Check with sort_values and tail
- Say what we'll do next time

## Challenges

- Minimum price for a stay
- Names of cheapestb and most expensive
- How much area does the dataset cover?
