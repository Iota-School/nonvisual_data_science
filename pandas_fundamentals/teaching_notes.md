Creating a dataframe

- Create three lists

	- budget = [10, 10, 5, 15, 15]
	- month = ["June", "July", "September", "October", "November"]n
	- cookie_budget = [3, 2, 0, 4, 5]
	
- Create monthly_budget dictionary
- Create dataframe
- Dataframe representation
- Not really missing out in not using representation

Finding size of dataframe
Getting columns index
Overwrite the index with the month
Pulling out a column
Doubling the cookie budget
