# Challenge Questions

These questions can be answered using what we've learned in this workshop and are provided for those who wish a little extra challenge.

- One of the columns are the minimum nights you can stay in the Airbnb. If the minimum nights value is above 1, you must stay at the rental for more than one night. Use a mathematical operation to create a series that shows the minimum price for an Airbnb stay, taking into account both the price and the minimum nights. For extra credit, look up how to add this series to our dataset as a column.
- What are the names of some of the cheapest and most expensive Airbnb rentals? You may wish to use a combination of sorting and `loc` or `iloc`.
- There are latitude and longitude columns in the dataset for the location of each Airbnb listing. Using `min()` and `max()` methods, can you figure out how much geographical area the data set covers? (If you want to convert your answer to conventional distance, a degree of latitude is about 69.2 miles or 111 kilometers. Near New York, a degree of longitude is about 53 miles or 85 kilometers)
