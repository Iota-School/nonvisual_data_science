## Tips

- The dictionary starts with a curly brace and ends with a curly brace. 
- Each key-value pair is separated by a comma.
- The key is separated from the value with a colon.
- The keys are strings, so they need quotes around them. Use either single or double quotes, don't mix and match.
- The suggested variable name has an underscore in it: `phone_book`
